public static void main(String[] args)
{
  system.out.println("hi this is yashaswini")
 }
 
 public:
        It is an access modifier . It specifies where and who can aceess the method.
        Making the main() method public makes it globally available.
        It is made public so that JVM can invoke it from outside the class as it is not present in the current class.
        
 static:
        It is a keyword which is when associated with a method, makes it a class related method.
        The main() method is static so that JVM can invoke it without instantiating the class.
        This also saves the unnecessary wastage of memory which would have been used by the object declared only for calling the main() method by the JVM.
        
 void:
      It is a keyword and used to specify that a method doesn't return anything.
      As main() method does't return anything its return type is void .
      As soon as the main method terminates the java program terminates too.
      
main:
    It is the name of java main method.
    It is the Identifier that the JVM looks for as the starting point of java program.
    It's not a keyword.
    
String[] args:
      It stores java command line arguments and is an array of type java.lang.String class.
      Here the name of the String array is args but it is not fixed and user can use any name in place of it.
